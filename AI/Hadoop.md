# Hadoop
n open-source framework for distributed storage and processing of large datasets across clusters of commodity hardware. 






                                          
## Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS):
                                          HDFS is a distributed file system 
                                          that stores data across multiple nodes in a Hadoop cluster. 
                                          
                                          It provides high-throughput access
                                          to data and ensures fault tolerance
                                          by replicating data blocks across multiple nodes.
