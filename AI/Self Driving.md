A. demand planning, 
                          is the process of forecasting future demand for a product or service based on
                          historical data, market trends, and other relevant factors.
                          It involves analyzing 
                          past sales data, market research, customer behavior, and other factors
                          to predict how much of a product or service will be needed in the future. 
                          Demand planning helps businesses make informed decisions 
                          about production, inventory management, and resource allocation to meet customer demand effectively 
                          while minimizing costs and 
                          avoiding stockouts or excess inventory.
                          
B. pickup / dropoff optimization, 
                           refers to the process of optimizing the scheduling and 
                           routing of pickups and dropoffs for goods or services. 
                           This optimization aims
                           to minimize travel time, distance, and costs
                           while maximizing efficiency and customer satisfaction. 
                           It involves determining the most efficient routes for pickup and delivery vehicles, 
                           considering factors such as traffic conditions, 
                           vehicle capacity, time windows for pickups and deliveries,
                           and customer preferences. 
                           Pickup/dropoff optimization is essential 
                           for logistics(물류) and transportation companies,
                           food delivery services, and any business involved
                           in the movement of goods or services.
C. fleet optimization,

                          used for transportation or delivery purposes.
                          It includes optimizing vehicle routing, 
                          scheduling, maintenance, and utilization to minimize costs, 
                          reduce fuel consumption, 
                          improve service levels, and
                          increase overall fleet performance. 
                          
                          Fleet optimization solutions often use 
                          advanced algorithms and software 
                          to analyze data, optimize routes, 
                          track vehicles in real-time,(GPS)
                          and make data-driven decisions 
                          to improve fleet operations.

D. field escalation handling

                              the process of managing and resolving escalated issues or incidents that occur in the field, 
                              such as service disruptions,
                              equipment failures, or
                              customer complaints.
                              It involves quickly identifying and addressing issues,
                              coordinating field personnel,
                              resources, and support teams to resolve problems efficiently, 
                              
                              and ensuring timely communication with customers or stakeholders.
                              Effective field escalation handling is crucial for maintaining customer satisfaction, 
                              minimizing downtime, and preserving the reputation of the business.

                                          and moving large amounts of log data from various sources
                                          to centralized storage or processing systems,
                                          
                                          such as Hadoop HDFS or Apache Kafka. 
                                          It is commonly used in big data environments for real-time data ingestion and processing.
