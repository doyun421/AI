Speed Limits:
Self-driving cars typically "adhere to"
posted speed limits
to ensure "compliance" with local traffic laws and "regulations". 
Waymo's autonomous driving technology would include algorithms 
to detect speed limit signs and adjust the vehicle's speed "accordingly".



Environmental Conditions: 
The speed of the self-driving car may also be influenced by environmental conditions such as weather (e.g., rain, snow) and road conditions (e.g., construction, traffic congestion). 
Waymo's vehicles use various sensors (such as LiDAR, cameras, radar) 
and real-time data processing to detect and respond to changing environmental conditions.

Safety Considerations: 
Safety is paramount in autonomous driving. 
Waymo's self-driving system continuously monitors the vehicle's surroundings 
and makes decisions to ensure safe operation.
This includes maintaining safe distances from other vehicles, pedestrians, and obstacles.

Traffic Flow: 
On highways, self-driving cars may adjust their speed based on the flow of traffic,
maintaining a safe and efficient distance from other vehicles. Waymo's 
vehicles are equipped with advanced perception and decision-making capabilities to navigate complex highway scenarios.

User Preferences: In some cases, users or passengers may have preferences regarding the vehicle's speed. Waymo's autonomous driving technology may incorporate user interface features that allow passengers to adjust certain parameters, including speed settings.

It's important to note that the specifics of how Waymo sets the speed of its self-driving cars may be proprietary and subject to ongoing research and development. Additionally, regulations and guidelines regarding autonomous vehicle operation may vary by region and evolve over time.
