# Hadoop
n open-source framework for distributed storage and processing of large datasets across clusters of commodity hardware. 






                                          
## Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS):
                                          HDFS is a distributed file system 
                                          that stores data across multiple nodes in a Hadoop cluster. 
                                          
                                          It provides high-throughput access
                                          to data and ensures fault tolerance
                                          by replicating data blocks across multiple nodes.

### High-throughput access 
                                       transfer data at a rapid rate, 
                                       support simultaneous read and write operations
                                       from multiple clients or applications.
                                                    A. Data Processing: 
                                                                          High-throughput access allows for the rapid processing 
                                                                          of large datasets, enabling applications 
                                                                          to quickly analyze, transform, or generate insights from the data. 
                                                                          
                                                                          This is essential for tasks such as batch processing, 
                                                                          data analytics, machine learning, and real-time data processing.
                                                    B. Data Transfer: 
                                                                          High-throughput access facilitates fast and efficient data transfer between storage systems, 
                                                                          nodes within a cluster, or between distributed systems. 
                                                                          This is particularly important in distributed computing environments 
                                                                          where data needs to be moved between different components for processing, analysis, or replication.
                                                                          
                                                                          b. Purpose of Data Transfer
                                                                                                     
                                                                                                      Hadoop's architecture is based on the principle of
                                                                                                      moving computation to the data rather than
                                                                                                      moving data to the computation, which is known as data locality.

                                                                                                      Data Locality:
                                                                                                                         the computation is executed on the nodes where the data resides.
                                                                                                                         This minimizes data movement across the network and reduces network I/O, which can be a bottleneck in distributed systems.
                                                                                                      MapReduce Processing
## ***Chunck***                                                                                                                          
        Suppose we have a large dataset containing information about car trips, including details such as:

                        1. Trip start and end times
                        2. Trip duration
                        3. Starting and ending locations (latitude and longitude)
                        4. Distance traveled
                        5. Average speed
                        6. Driver ID or vehicle ID
                        This dataset could be quite extensive, containing millions of records.

        To process this data using MapReduce, we would first split it into smaller, manageable chunks. Each chunk would contain a subset of the total dataset. For example:

                        Input Split 1: Contains data for car trips that occurred between January 1, 2023, and January 15, 2023. - chunk 1
                        Input Split 2: Contains data for car trips that occurred between January 16, 2023, and January 31, 2023. - chunk 2
                        Input Split 3: Contains data for car trips that occurred between February 1, 2023, and February 15, 2023. - chunk 3
                        Input Split 4: Contains data for car trips that occurred between February 16, 2023, and February 28, 2023. - chunk 4
                        And so on...
