apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-web-app
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-web-app-container
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
In this example:

apiVersion and kind define the Kubernetes API version and the type of object being defined (in this case, a Pod).
metadata specifies metadata about the Pod, such as its name.
spec defines the desired state of the Pod, including the container(s) it should run.
Inside the spec, containers contains a list of containers to run within the Pod.
Each container is defined with a name, an image specifying the Docker image to use, and optionally, ports to expose.
